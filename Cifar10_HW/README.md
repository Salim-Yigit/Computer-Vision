This is a homework of Computer Vision lecture.  
In this assignment,we were asked to generate diffrent models with different parameters.  
These parameters were filter's numbers(32 or 64),filter's size(3 or 5), conv layers' numbers other words depth(3 or 5).  
We have used cifar10 dataset.   
We should choose best model then predict test set with best model.

Also we were asked plotted confusion matrix.

For each classes we picked 3 random pictures, then we found out the 5 most similar classes for each picture.

In the end, we have a table which includes actual class and 5 similar classes of each picture.
