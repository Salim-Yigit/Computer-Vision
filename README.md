# Computer-Vision
This repo contains my computer vision studies.   
I have collected some of the works that I have done so far under different folders.  
One of these is about Neural Style Transfer, I have implemented Gatsy algorithm from scracth.  
If you want to look in detail, you can check Neural Style Transfer folder.  
Another folder is about image classification. Cifar10 dataset was used.  
It was a lecture homework,multiple models were implemented with different parameters and they were compared with each other.  
Tensorflow keras was used in implementation.
